Meal planning can help you achieve your results faster. By preparing your meals for a select period of time you can better stick to calorie and diet regimes.

So why don't more people prepare their meals? There are 4 main reasons as to why people don't meal prep:

**1. They don't have time**

For those who go out a lot during the weekend and come home late at night it can be very daunting to try and fit a cooking session into your plans. However Meal planning doesn't have to to take up a lot of your time to be effective.

In fact meal planning can help you save time especially if you choose recipes that don't require cooking. Take for example this [Chickpea, Feta and Kale Salad Recipe](https://8fit.com/recipes/chickpea-feta-kale-salad-recipe/). It can be prepared in less than 20 minutes and could be your lunch for the week.

**2. They get bored of eating the same thing for a long period of time**

There are those out there that can never eat the same food more than twice. But there is a solution to varying up the food that you eat!

You can create a base ingredient and vary the ingredients on every meal. Take for example this [Chicken Burrito Bowls Recipe](https://tasty.co/recipe/weekday-meal-prep-chicken-burrito-bowls). It uses a lot of vegetables that do not require cooking. You can add/remove vegetables that you wan't to try (e.g: Avocado, Chillis, Sweet Onions) and keep the meal varied throughout the week.

**3. They don't like cooking**

Choose recipes that don't require cooking. Take for example this [Mediterranean Tuna salad Recipe](https://www.taste.com.au/recipes/mediterranean-tuna-salad/e3fb7eaf-79cf-45f9-8e13-9592727b92b8). It can be prepared in less than 30 minutes and could be your lunch/dinner for the week.

**4. I don't have the containers necessary to do it**

Food containers are fairly cheap to pickup. I use [2 Compartment Meal Prep Containers](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B073Q3BGP6/) for my meals and it only cost me Â£10.95 for 14 containers.

If you're worried about the cost bear in mind that meal planning can help you save money and avoid unneeded food costs throughout the week.
